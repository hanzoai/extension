# Dev - Ship Up to 100X Faster with Parallel AI Agents

## The Future of Development is Parallel

Run unlimited AI agents simultaneously. Access your entire codebase instantly. Ship features in minutes, not hours.

## 🚀 Parallel Execution Changes Everything

### Traditional AI Tools: Sequential Bottleneck
```
Ask AI → Wait → Debug → Ask Again → Wait → Debug...
⏱️ Each query: 30s - 2min
🔄 Context lost between queries
🐛 Debug hallucinated imports
```

### Dev Platform: Parallel Intelligence
```
dev enhance "implement complete auth system"
→ 10 agents spawn instantly
→ All work simultaneously  
→ Results in 30 seconds
✅ Everything just works
```

## 🧠 Core Technology

### 1. **Unlimited Parallel Agents**
- Spawn 10, 50, or 100+ agents at once
- Each runs in isolated git worktrees
- No conflicts, no waiting
- Linear scaling with task complexity

### 2. **Unified Memory System**
- Your entire codebase vectorized and indexed
- Every file, every pattern, instantly accessible
- Semantic search across all code
- Git history awareness

### 3. **Multi-Model Orchestration**
- 200+ LLMs via Hanzo AI gateway
- Automatic model selection per task
- Consensus validation available
- Local LLM support (Ollama, LM Studio)

### 4. **Cloud.Hanzo.AI Integration**
- Single login for all AI tools
- Unified billing and usage tracking
- Access your indexed repositories
- Team collaboration features

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Sequential AI | Dev Parallel |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Simple feature (auth) | 30-120 min | 30-60 sec |
| Complex feature (API) | 2-8 hours | 2-5 min |
| Multi-file refactor | 4-12 hours | 5-10 min |
| Test suite generation | 1-3 hours | 1-2 min |
| Documentation update | 30-60 min | 30 sec |

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. Analyze Task
```bash
dev enhance "add real-time chat with websockets"
```
- Parses request semantics
- Identifies affected systems
- Plans optimal agent distribution

### 2. Spawn Parallel Agents
```
Agent 1: WebSocket server implementation
Agent 2: Client-side connection manager
Agent 3: Message protocol design
Agent 4: Database schema updates
Agent 5: Authentication integration
Agent 6: Test suite creation
Agent 7: Error handling
Agent 8: Documentation
```

### 3. Execute Simultaneously
- All agents work in parallel
- Each in isolated git worktree
- No blocking, no waiting
- Results stream in real-time

### 4. Merge & Validate
- Automatic conflict resolution
- Optional consensus validation
- Single unified PR
- Ready to review and merge
