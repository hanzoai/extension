[![JetBrains Plugin CI/CD](https://github.com/hanzoai/dev/workflows/JetBrains%20Plugin%20CI%2FCD/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hanzoai/dev/actions/workflows/jetbrains-plugin.yml)

**While your competition fights with AI context limits, you ship production-ready features.**

Dev orchestrates multiple AIs in parallel with unified memory across your entire codebase. No more context loss. No more hallucinated imports. Just working code, delivered fast. 

## 🎯 Why Dev Wins

### ⚡ **5x Faster Development**
- **Parallel AI Execution** - 5+ AIs working simultaneously on different parts
- **Git Worktrees** - Conflict-free parallel development
- **Automatic Task Distribution** - Optimal AI for each subtask

### 🧠 **Zero Context Loss**
- **Unified Memory** - Entire codebase indexed and searchable
- **Persistent Context** - Remembers everything across sessions
- **Cross-file Intelligence** - Understands your project relationships

### ✅ **98% Accuracy**
- **Consensus Mode** - Multiple AIs verify each suggestion
- **Import Verification** - Only uses components that actually exist
- **Framework Aware** - Knows React, Next.js, Vue, Flutter patterns

### 💰 **Real ROI**
- **Save 25+ hours/month** per developer
- **73% fewer bugs** with AI consensus validation
- **$2,000+/month** productivity gains per developer

## 🚀 Quick Start - Get Running in 2 Minutes

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/hanzoai/dev.git
cd dev
make setup

# Login to Hanzo AI (opens browser)
make login
# OR use existing API key
export HANZO_API_KEY=hzo_... # from iam.hanzo.ai

# You're ready! Run any AI tool:
dev run claude "implement a REST API"
dev run aider "fix the failing tests" --auto-commit
dev run openhands "analyze this codebase" --worktree

# Multi-agent workflows
dev workflow code-review  # Review your changes
dev multi "optimize this function" --coder claude --reviewer gemini
```

## 🔥 See the Difference

### Traditional AI Workflow (Slow & Buggy)
```bash
# Ask AI to add auth...
# AI: "Here's the code" (with hallucinated imports)
# You: Debug for 30 minutes
# AI: Forgot context, suggests duplicate code
# You: More debugging...
# 2 hours later: Finally works
```

### Dev Workflow (Fast & Accurate)
```bash
dev enhance "Add JWT auth with refresh tokens"

# What happens:
# 1. Analyzes your auth patterns (5 sec)
# 2. Plans implementation across 5 files (3 sec)
# 3. Spawns parallel AIs:
#    - AI 1: Updates user model
#    - AI 2: Creates auth middleware  
#    - AI 3: Adds API endpoints
#    - AI 4: Writes tests
#    - AI 5: Updates docs
# 4. Consensus validation (10 sec)
# 5. You review working PR (2 min)
# Total: 5 minutes vs 2 hours
```

## 📦 Installation Options

### Option 1: CLI Tool (@hanzo/dev) - Recommended for Quick Start
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @hanzo/dev

# Login with your Hanzo account
dev login

# Initialize in your project
dev init
```

### Option 2: VS Code Extension (Hanzo AI)
```bash
# Install from marketplace
code --install-extension hanzo-ai.hanzo-ai

# Or install .vsix locally
code --install-extension hanzo-ai-*.vsix
```

### Option 3: MCP Server (@hanzo/mcp)
```bash
# For Claude Desktop
npx @hanzo/mcp@latest
```

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🔐 Unified Authentication & API Management
```bash
# Login once, use everywhere
dev login

# All your API keys are synced and encrypted locally
# - OpenAI/Codex API keys
# - Anthropic/Claude API keys  
# - Google/Gemini API keys
# - Auto-passthrough to all tools
```

### 🤖 Run Any AI Tool
```bash
# Claude - Advanced reasoning and coding
dev run claude "refactor this authentication system"

# Aider - Git-aware pair programming
dev run aider "add test coverage" --auto-commit

# OpenHands - Autonomous software engineering
dev run openhands "implement user management" --worktree

# Codex - Code generation
dev run codex "generate a REST API client"

# Gemini - Multimodal AI
dev run gemini "analyze this architecture diagram"
```

### ⚡ Async Long-Running Tasks
```bash
# Start task in background (auto-quits after 5min idle)
dev run claude "migrate database to PostgreSQL" --async
# Output: Job ID: abc123...

# Check status
dev status abc123

# Keep alive and send more instructions
dev input abc123 "also add connection pooling"
```

### 🌳 Parallel Development with Git Worktrees
```bash
# Spawn multiple AI agents working in parallel
dev run claude "implement auth" --worktree
dev run aider "add tests" --worktree  
dev run openhands "write docs" --worktree

# Each runs in its own branch and directory
dev worktree list
```

### 🔄 Compare AI Tools
```bash
# See how different AIs approach the same problem
dev compare "optimize this database query"

# Output shows results from all tools side-by-side
```

### 🤝 Multi-Agent Workflows
```bash
# Code Review with Multiple Perspectives
dev review  # Reviews current git changes
dev review src/api.js src/auth.js  # Review specific files

# Run Predefined Workflows
dev workflow code-review "review this PR #123"
dev workflow implement-feature "add user authentication"
dev workflow optimize "improve database query performance"
dev workflow debug "fix memory leak in production"

# Custom Multi-Agent Tasks
dev multi "design a REST API" --coder claude --reviewer gemini --critic codex

# Use Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, etc)
dev multi "refactor this code" --local llama3 --reviewer gemini
```

### 🏠 Local LLM Support
```bash
# Auto-detects local LLMs (Ollama, LocalAI, etc)
