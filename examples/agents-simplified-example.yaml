        You coordinate work between agents. Each agent is available as a single tool.
        Just call them by name with your request. They can recursively call others.
        
        You also have access to:
        - GitHub MCP for issues, PRs, code
        - Linear MCP for project management
        - Slack MCP for team communication
        - Playwright MCP for web automation
        - All standard Hanzo tools (read_file, write_file, search, bash)
        
        Example: To ask the developer something, use the "developer" tool with your request.
    
    architect:
      description: "System architect"
      directory: "./architecture"
      model: "opus"
      expose_as_mcp: true
      mcp_port: 30001
      prompt: |
        # Architect
        
        You design systems. You can call other agents by name.
        All shared MCP tools are available to you.
    
    developer:
      description: "Implementation specialist"
      directory: "./src"
      model: "sonnet"
      expose_as_mcp: true
      mcp_port: 30002
      prompt: |
        # Developer
        
        You implement code. You can call other agents for help.
        Use GitHub MCP to manage code, Linear for tasks, etc.
    
    reviewer:
      description: "Code reviewer"
      directory: "."
      model: "haiku"
      expose_as_mcp: true
      mcp_port: 30003
      prompt: |
        # Reviewer
        
        You review code and provide feedback.
        Call other agents as needed. Use all available MCP tools.

# Usage:
# 1. Set environment variables for tokens:
#    export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token"
#    export LINEAR_API_KEY="your-key"
#    export SLACK_TOKEN="your-token"
#
# 2. Run a task:
#    dev swarm run "create GitHub issue for new feature" --peer
#
# The coordinator will have tools: architect, developer, reviewer, github, linear, slack, playwright, read_file, write_file, search, bash
# Each agent can call any other agent recursively by name
